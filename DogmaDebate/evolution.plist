		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is Evolution?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Definition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Biological evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This definition encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations). Evolution helps us to understand the history of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Explanation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Biological evolution is not simply a matter of change over time. Lots of things change over time: trees lose their leaves, mountain ranges rise and erode, but they aren&apos;t examples of biological evolution because they don&apos;t involve descent through genetic inheritance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The central idea of biological evolution is that all life on Earth shares a common ancestor, just as you and your cousins share a common grandmother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Through the process of descent with modification, the common ancestor of life on Earth gave rise to the fantastic diversity that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today. Evolution means that we&apos;re all distant cousins: humans and oak trees, hummingbirds and whales.</string>

		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evidence for Evolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One body of evidence Darwin turned to for his theory was artificial selection: the changes humans have caused in crops, livestock and pets. Humans have bred dogs, birds, cows and corn to their desires for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. If farmers and breeders could bring about such big changes in the short time span of recorded history, what could nature do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
￼
 
Artificial selection shows the power of an outside selective force acting on a species, but that&apos;s not the only evidence for evolution. Other factors point to common origin for life forms. Bats, dolphins and people are all mammals, but bats fly, dolphins swim, and humans type, dine and doodle. If each species were carefully designed from scratch, there wouldn&apos;t be much need for overlap in skeletal structure. Yet all three types of animals share the same general limb design. Humans, dolphins and bats all have upper arm bones, lower arm bones, wrists, hand bones, and fingers. In dolphins, these bones are shortened to make a stiff flipper. Bats, meanwhile, spread their wings out over their finger bones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why would evolution do this? Because it works with whatever it&apos;s got handy (pardon the pun). Evolution can&apos;t see the future and it can&apos;t change the past. It can only cope with the present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another example of evolution working with what it&apos;s got appears in the difference between how whales and fish swim. Fish and their ancestors have always lived in the water. Whales moved back into the water after their ancestors wandered around on land. When fish swim, they wriggle their tails sideways, rather like a snake slithers. In contrast, whales move their tails up and down, because they inherited spines that were once attached to running legs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Darwin pointed out the things he and his contemporaries could observe in the 19th century. In the 20th century, the neo darwinian synthesis combined Darwin&apos;s theory of natural selection withGregor Mendel&apos;s discoveries related to genetics, and not long afterwards James Watson and Francis Crick uncovered the physical structure of DNA. This led to a whole new set of discoveries about common ancestry, such as some organisms carrying long-deactivated genes that were more useful to their ancestors. Dolphins and whales, for instance, carry hundreds of genes related to sensing smell in an air-based (not water-based) environment. But because these animals have returned to the water, those genes are no longer functional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DNA studies help humans find our own spot in the tree of life. Comparing the genetic material of humans and other great apes shows that our DNA differs within our own species by about 0.1 percent, with that of the chimpanzees by about 1.2 percent, and with that of the gorillas by about 1.6 percent. Yet humans and African apes (including gorillas) all share more similar DNA than the African apes share with orangutans, which dwell in Asia. Darwin predicted that humans branched off from other apes in Africa and modern studies back up his hypothesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
More striking than similarities among great apes are DNA similarities between a much wider range of animals. Analysis of human versus fruit fly DNA indicates that we use basically the same genes, just in different ways with different combinations and different timing. Scientists have also pinpointed some specific genes that do different things in different organisms. A gene that geneticists have dubbed BMP4 both strengthens the jaws of fish that eat a robust shellfish diet, and bulks up beaks of Galapagos ground finches. Another gene identified as FOXP2 helps young finches learn to sing, and young humans to speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Gene studies have turned up groups of genes, sometimes called modules or termed &quot;deep homology,&quot; that have continued working with each other for (literally) millions of years. Like steadfast bowling buddies, these genes have stuck together even as the organisms they created evolved and the genes&apos; jobs changed. A hunt for genes that code human blood vessels, for example, identified five genes — and turned up the same genes in an astonishing place: yeast. In these unicellular fungi, the genes repair damaged cell walls. A hunt for genes involved in the human nervous system found the same genes in completely nerveless protists known as choanoflagellates. Human eyes and jellyfish eyes use the same clusters of genes to detect light. So far, geneticists have detected almost 50 modules shared by people and plants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And then there are genes that manage the big picture in a variety of organisms. First found in fruit flies, hox genes regulate overall body plans for everything from bugs to birds. Arguably grisly experiments with these genes show that moving them around creates fairly disgusting mutants, like flies with legs sprouting from their heads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
￼
Even more basic than hox genes are the building blocks for all genes; DNA is the acronym for deoxyribonucleic acid. With the exception of some viruses that rely on just ribonucleic acid (RNA), all life on earth uses DNA. And in organisms with DNA, RNA helps transcribe genes into proteins. These building blocks of inheritance are common all living things on this planet.
Evolution still happens today, and it&apos;s still driven by natural selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the glaciers retreated at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, migratory marine fish moved into lakes and streams in North America and Eurasia. Adapting to new foods, new threats and new water conditions has diversified these stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) so much that they show greater diversity in their body plans than different genera of fish. Variations include dramatic differences in the size or number of bony plates, body build and tooth structure. Some sticklebacks sport fins that other sticklebacks completely lack. And because sticklebacks often stick to their own size when it comes to mating, that promotes isolation of different reproductive groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Off Florida&apos;s Gulf Coast lies a geologically young island archipelago, inhabited by pale-hued mice, Peromyscus polionotus. The mice have light coats, making them mix better with pale beach sand than their darker mainland mice relatives, and the lighter coats result from small changes in the expression of a single gene during embryonic development. The beach mice&apos;s genetic mutation occurred after the beach islands formed some 6,000 years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bird lovers who stock bird feeders for European songbirds known as blackcaps, or Sylvia atricapilla, have managed to encourage two groups of birds, one that eats fruit and winters in the Mediterranean, and another that dines at bird feeders while wintering in the UK. The UK birds have rounder wings and skinnier beaks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Between 1947 and 1977, General Electric released polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Hudson River. PCBs can cause nasty deformities in fish larvae, such as missing jaws. But recent observations of one type of bottom-dwelling fish, tomcod, showed that they didn&apos;t suffer PCB-induced deformities. It turns out that most tomcod in the New York region carry a beneficial mutation in a gene named AHR2. Normally PCBs latch onto the proteins encoded by AHR2, but the useful mutation enables the proteins to evade the PCBs&apos; grasp. Farther away from the source of PCB pollution, fewer tomcod carry the mutated gene; hardly any tomcod in northern New England or Canada have it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Studies of mosquitoes in the London Underground (subway system) have turned up new speciation — in Darwin&apos;s own neighborhood, and since the publication of Origin. Culex pipiens is the world&apos;s most widespread mosquito species. In London, it occurs in two varieties: C. pipiens pipiens, which lives above ground, and C. pipiens molestus, which lives underground. At high latitudes, the mosquito species are quite distinct from each other, partly because only the surface variety goes into hiding and stores fat during the winter. In the 1990s, a pair of geneticists began studying mosquitoes in London&apos;s Underground. Like subterranean mosquitoes elsewhere, the Underground bugs stayed active in the winter months. Yet the geneticists found that the Underground mosquitoes showed the greatest genetic similarity to local mosquitoes that lived at the surface. Furthermore, the mosquitoes inhabiting the subway system showed far less genetic variation than their relatives up top — evidence of a much younger population. When the researchers tried mating Underground bugs from different parts of the subway system, they had no trouble making babies, but when the researchers tried breeding them with surface varieties, no babies resulted. The evidence indicates that a group of surface mosquitoes took up residence in the Underground (which first came into use in 1863) and, in reproductive isolation, established a new species.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Besides the DNA overlap with apes, some of the strongest evidence for evolution comes from our own species. Humans long believed ourselves to be the highest form of life on earth, made in the image of God. If so, our perfection needs a little work. Some of us have flat feet, heel spurs, and ankles prone to recurring sprains. Some of us have cracked vertebrae and slipped disks — unfortunate results of upending a spine that had long been horizontal in four-legged animals. Women got an especially raw deal: hips so wide they place extra strain on knees, yet not wide enough to make childbirth the least bit easy.
Ever suffered from the hiccups? Thank the convoluted path that nerves must follow between your brain stem and your diaphragm; in fish, those nerves enjoy a less troublesome route. Many of us harbor painful memories of wisdom tooth extraction, made necessary by jaws less robust than our ancestors&apos;. (While many of us gave our third molars to our dentists, some populations have largely dispensed with those bothersome extra teeth. One study concluded that prehistoric people of Mexico had no wisdom teeth, and another study found 25 percent of Mexico&apos;s current population missing at least one wisdom tooth.) We humans have appendices, perhaps useful to our ancestors, but in us useless leftovers that occasionally inflame and rupture. Before the invention of surgery and the adoption of surgical hygiene, your own appendix could easily kill you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Again, why did evolution do these annoying things? Because evolution doesn&apos;t have to be perfect, it merely has to be effective. It only has to be good enough to give you sufficient time to pass on your genes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Today, benefited by sterile surgeries, antibiotics, vaccines, car ownership and convenience stores, we humans in the developed world must cope with new epidemics: diabetes and obesity. Our bodies — better adapted to a hunter-gatherer world where calories were scarce and exercise was abundant, where our bodies had to store fat to get us through long spells of little or no food — don&apos;t deal so well with the modern glut of cheeseburgers, bourbon and Twinkies. Today, overweight people outnumber underweight people the world over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mismatch between our hunter-gatherer bodies and modern diets is also apparent in dental health — or lack of it. Besides more robust jaws, ancient humans had far fewer cavities. Studies of thousands of fossil humans found cavities in less than 2 percent of them. That began to change with the advent of farming and the consumption of cereal, but the problem got far worse with the introduction of affordable sugar within the last few centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Studies of different human populations indicate that human evolution continued not only after we branched off from apes, but even long after Paleolithic times. People whose ancestors came from warm, lowland environments, who had to work hard for all their meals even after food became abundant elsewhere, tend to have slow metabolisms. People whose ancestors came from cold, highland environments tend to have high metabolisms. While one group had to survive long periods of famine, the other group likely had to metabolize lots of animal fat. What both groups have in common are lifestyle diseases in response to a modern Western diet and lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
City life has apparently shaped human evolution, too. In centuries past — and in many parts of the world today — urban living has been tough, thanks to cramped and dirty living conditions. As a result, cities and tuberculosis go way back. Surviving such challenges over the long haul has entailed evolving resistance to the disease. A study published in 2010 correlated a genetic makeup that confers a resistance to tuberculosis and a few other maladies with a long duration of urban settlements. Iranians and Turks living around ancient cities had high resistance; Sami (or Saami) and Malawians living in places that weren&apos;t urbanized before the late 19th century had much lower resistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Evolution of other organisms plays a role in human healthcare. Since humans learned about antibiotics, we&apos;ve used them to fight infection, but we haven&apos;t always enjoyed the results we wanted.Staphylococcus (staph infection) evolved a resistance to Penicillin in 1946, to Methicillin in 1961, to Vancomycin in 1986, and to Zyvox in 1999. Growing resistance of hospital &quot;superbugs&quot; to antibiotics spread across six European Union nations between October 2010 and March 2011. Meanwhile, the HIV virus evolves so quickly that multiple species can thrive in a single patient. On these fronts, at least, evolution appears to be working against us.

In the wild, most parents produce more babies than can possibly survive. When sea turtles hatch, hundreds of them poke out of their shells and head for the ocean, desperately flopping their tiny legs as fast as they can. Many of them don&apos;t even reach the water; they&apos;re picked off by seagulls instead. Once in the water, many more baby turtles become snacks for their neighbors in their new watery neighborhood. Even if they avoid becoming a meal themselves, they have to find meals of their own, and food can be pretty limited in the wild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 	
Darwin cited artificial selection wrought by humans as evidence of the selective pressure environment can exert. Illustration from Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea by Carl Zimmer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Some life forms on earth — such as some bacteria, plants, even animals — reproduce by cloning — making exact replicas of themselves. In such populations, everybody is the same. For the rest of us, sex introduces variation into a population. Darwin pondered this variation, particularly the differences between the animals that survive and pass their characteristics on to their offspring, and those that instead get snatched up in the jaws of defeat. He (and Wallace) found that the key to surviving and producing offspring has to do with suitability to the environment. Birds that need to see their prey from afar, then swoop down and snatch up a meal, benefit from keen eyesight. Hunting birds with lousy eyesight often go hungry. Lizards scurrying around in forest floor litter benefit from good camouflage and swift legs. In a (literal) pinch, the ability to part with one&apos;s tail can keep a lizard alive. Ditto an octopus arm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In other words, the life forms best suited to their environments are likely to live the longest and produce the most offspring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

An assortment of tiny islands in the Bahamas recently gave researchers the chance to compare the roles of predation and competition in natural selection. The scientists stocked each island with lizards that they planned to observe, careful to ensure no reptilian island-hopping. Even before that, they measured and marked each lizard, and put each (un)willing experiment participant through a fitness test on a treadmill. Some islands were sparsely populated, meaning the lizards&apos; biggest challenge was predation. Other islands were crowded, so the biggest challenge in those places was beating the other lizards to the most calories. At the end of breeding season, the researchers sifted through their results and discovered that competition for resources was a bigger driver of natural selection than predation. Local predators turned out to be unfussy eaters. The lizards that won the chow contest on crowded islands, however, were bigger and more athletic than the survivors on un-crowded islands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Even when an organism is well-suited to a particular environment, and can out-compete others for limited resources, that&apos;s no guarantee of everlasting success. Environments can change. Lakes can dry up. Weather patterns can shift. A new species of vegetation can set up camp, favoring a new color of camouflage in lizards rustling around in the leaves. Any organism that happens to possess a characteristic well suited to the new environment will do better than its peers. Over time, the new characteristic may become so preferable to the old one that the population eventually looks different from how it used to look.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Darwin couldn&apos;t know about the discoveries of genetics that would follow in the 20th century. Genes — the inherited instructions that tell our cells what to do and tell our bodies what to look like — are passed from one generation to the next with remarkable accuracy. But every once in awhile, something goes wrong. The instructions get botched. These random mistakes are mutations. People often think of mutations as invariably harmful, but that&apos;s not always the case. Many (perhaps most) mutations have little or no effect, and some mutations are life savers. One example in human DNA is known as delta 32. When the plague, often referred to as the Black Death, struck Europe, it devastated the population, but a lucky few survived. They carried the delta 32 mutation that conferred resistance to the disease. The same mutation appears to confer a resistance to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</string>

		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are all species related?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. Just as the tree of life illustrates, all organisms, both living and extinct, are related. Every branch of the tree represents a species, and every fork separating one species from another represents the common ancestor shared by these species. While the tree&apos;s countless forks and far-reaching branches clearly show that relatedness among species varies greatly, it is also easy to see that every pair of species share a common ancestor from some point in evolutionary history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, scientists estimate that the common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees lived some 5 to 8 million years ago. Humans and bacteria obviously share a much more distant common ancestor, but our relationship to these single-celled organisms is no less real. Indeed, DNA analyses show that although humans share far more genetic material with our fellow primates than we do with single-celled organisms, we still have more than 200 genes in common with bacteria. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It is important to realize that describing organisms as relatives does not mean that one of those organisms is an ancestor of the other, or, for that matter, that any living species is the ancestor of any other living species. A person may be related to blood relatives, such as cousins, aunts, and uncles, because she shares with them one or more common ancestors, such as a grandparent, or great-grandparent. But those cousins, aunts, and uncles are not her ancestors. In the same way, humans and other living primates are related, but none of these living relatives is a human ancestor. </string>

		<string>Isn&apos;t Evolution a Theory?</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isn&apos;t Evolution a theory?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, and so is Gravity.  First, we should clarify what &quot;evolution&quot; means. Like so many other words, it has more than one meaning. Its strict biological definition is &quot;a change in allele frequencies over time.&quot; By that definition, evolution is an indisputable fact. Most people seem to associate the word &quot;evolution&quot; mainly with common descent, the theory that all life arose from one common ancestor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many people believe that there is enough evidence to call this a fact, too. However, common descent is still not the theory of evolution, but just a fraction of it (and a part of several quite different theories as well). The theory of evolution not only says that life evolved, it also includes mechanisms, like mutations, natural selection, and genetic drift, which go a long way towards explaining how life evolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Calling the theory of evolution &quot;only a theory&quot; is, strictly speaking, true, but the idea it tries to convey is completely wrong. The argument rests on a confusion between what &quot;theory&quot; means in informal usage and in a scientific context. A theory, in the scientific sense, is &quot;a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena&quot; [Random House American College Dictionary]. The term does not imply tentativeness or lack of certainty. Generally speaking, scientific theories differ from scientific laws only in that laws can be expressed more tersely. Being a theory implies self-consistency, agreement with observations, and usefulness. (Creationism fails to be a theory mainly because of the last point; it makes few or no specific claims about what we would expect to find, so it can&apos;t be used for anything. When it does make falsifiable predictions, they prove to be false.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Lack of proof isn&apos;t a weakness, either. On the contrary, claiming infallibility for one&apos;s conclusions is a sign of hubris. Nothing in the real world has ever been rigorously proved, or ever will be. Proof, in the mathematical sense, is possible only if you have the luxury of defining the universe you&apos;re operating in. In the real world, we must deal with levels of certainty based on observed evidence. The more and better evidence we have for something, the more certainty we assign to it; when there is enough evidence, we label the something a fact, even though it still isn&apos;t 100% certain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

What evolution has is what any good scientific claim has--evidence, and lots of it. Evolution is supported by a wide range of observations throughout the fields of genetics, anatomy, ecology, animal behavior, paleontology, and others. If you wish to challenge the theory of evolution, you must address that evidence. You must show that the evidence is either wrong or irrelevant or that it fits another theory better. Of course, to do this, you must know both the theory and the evidence.</string>

		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why isn&apos;t Evolution a law?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an issue which often confuses the general public, as the two words have very different common meanings. But in science, their meanings are very similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A theory is an explanation which is backed by &quot;a considerable body of evidence,&quot; while a law is a set of regularities expressed in a &quot;mathematical statement.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is why Newton&apos;s Laws of Motion are referred to as laws and not theories. They are expressed with simple equations (like f = ma for his 2nd Law of Motion). Evolution, and most of Biology, cannot be expressed in a concise mathematical equation, so it is referred to as a theory. A scientific law is not &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more accurate&quot; than a scientific theory. A law explains what will happen under certain circumstances, while a theory explains how it happens.</string>

		<string>Has Evolution been observed?</string>

		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Has Evolution been observed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Biologists define evolution as a change in the gene pool of a population over time. One example is insects developing a resistance to pesticides over the period of a few years. Even most Creationists recognize that evolution at this level is a fact. What they don&apos;t appreciate is that this rate of evolution is all that is required to produce the diversity of all living things from a common ancestor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The origin of new species by evolution has also been observed, both in the laboratory and in the wild. See, for example, (Weinberg, J.R., V.R. Starczak, and D. Jorg, 1992, &quot;Evidence for rapid speciation following a founder event in the laboratory.&quot; Evolution 46: 1214-1220). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even without these direct observations, it would be wrong to say that evolution hasn&apos;t been observed. Evidence isn&apos;t limited to seeing something happen before your eyes. Evolution makes predictions about what we would expect to see in the fossil record, comparative anatomy, genetic sequences, geographical distribution of species, etc., and these predictions have been verified many times over. The number of observations supporting evolution is overwhelming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What hasn&apos;t been observed is one animal abruptly changing into a radically different one, such as a frog changing into a cow. This is not a problem for evolution because evolution doesn&apos;t propose occurrences even remotely like that. In fact, if we ever observed a frog turn into a cow, it would be very strong evidence against evolution.</string>

		<string>Evolution in the Fossil record</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evolution in the Fossil record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, he lamented the incompleteness of the fossil record. His friend T.H. Huxley disagreed, stating, &quot;The primary and direct evidence in favor of evolution can be furnished only by paleontology. . . . if evolution has taken place, there will its mark be left; if it has not taken place, there will lie its refutation.&quot; In a way, both men were right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To become a fossil, you have to be buried soon after you die — before weather or scavengers destroy your remains. The dirt and mud burying you then have to harden sufficiently to protect what&apos;s left of you over thousands or more likely millions of years. At some point, your remains have to find their way to the ground surface and erode out. And there&apos;s no guarantee that when your fossilized self sees the sun again that some human — let alone a human who knows or cares about fossils — will happen along at the right moment to find you. In other words, the odds of becoming a fossil are slim. The odds of being found as a fossil are slimmer still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So the fossil record is spotty at best, but even with so many pieces missing, it tells us quite a bit about the history of life on earth, and more discoveries happen all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the most important ways in which the rock record supports evolutionary theory is the succession of fossils in older versus newer rock layers. As far back as the 18th century, scholars realized that fossils in older layers differed more from modern life forms than fossils in newer layers. While many fossils from the Pleistocene Ice Age resemble organisms living today, far fewer fossils from the Age of Reptiles do. If you venture back in the rock record to the Precambrian (prior to roughly 550 million years ago), you&apos;ll find few fossils of multicellular organisms at all. So striking has this fossil succession been that when asked what would disprove evolution, 20th-century British scientist J.B.S. Haldane quipped, &quot;Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.&quot; No such bunnies have ever been found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One argument raised about the fossil record is that it has no transitional forms. Yet two of the earliest, most famous fossils ever found were stunning examples of transitional fossils. In 1860, the limestone quarry in Solnhofen, Germany, yielded a fossil feather. A year later, the same quarry gave up a better prize: a partial skeleton of Archaeopteryx lithographica. Sir Richard Owen, in all fairness a brilliant comparative anatomist, described the fossil as &quot;unequivocally a bird&quot; and suggested that, if the whole creature were found, it would look like a modern bird. It certainly wouldn&apos;t have any teeth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1877, a complete specimen was found at Solnhofen, and this fossil sported a toothy grin to refute Owen&apos;s prediction. It was a lizard- and bird-like fossil.&lt;br&gt;
Ichthyostega, Acanthostega and Tiktaalik are all examples of transitional fossils left by fish slowly transmogrifying into landlubbing tetrapods. Transitional forms also document the mammalian return to water. Paleontologist Phil Gingerich was overjoyed to find a whale ancestor, Rodhocetus, in Pakistan. Years earlier, he had been disappointed to find a fairly pedestrian fossil whale ancestor, Basilosaurus, in the same region. Yet he perked up considerably when he found the creature&apos;s diminutive legs. Why hadn&apos;t anybody found its legs before? Because nobody had looked. Why had nobody looked? &quot;Because whales don&apos;t have legs!&quot; Years later, Gingerich found fossils of the whale species Maiacetus inuus, including a pregnant mother. The whales&apos; teeth were well-suited to a diet of fish, but the fetus was positioned head-down, characteristic of life on land. Together, the fossils indicated another transitional form — a whale that lived most of its life in the sea, but had to return to land to give birth. Whale fossils have shown us other examples of change. Today&apos;s sperm whales lack upper teeth and rely on suction to partake of their prey, but in 2010, paleontologists described the skull of a gigantic, 12 to 13 million-year-old sperm whale whose lower and upper jaws sported teeth resembling steak knives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some of the most compelling — and to some, the most upsetting — evidence for evolution comes from our own human lineage. The first recognized fossil human, a Neanderthal fossil, appeared in Germany in 1856. Eugène Dubois who was born shortly afterwards, found a more ancient ancestor in Java, the first Homo erectus fossil. In the 20th century, Raymond Dart, and Louis and Mary Leakey found even more ancient Australopithecus fossils in Africa. In 1974, Donald Johanson and his team discovered Lucy, later classified as Australopithecus afarensis. Lucy overturned long-held assumptions that humans sprouted bigger brains before they started walking upright. In the fall of 2004, Peter Brown, Mike Morwood and their colleagues made probably the most astonishing announcement to date. They had found an 18,000-year-old, 1-meter-tall &quot;hobbit,&quot; Homo floresiensis. Controversy raged around the hobbits, with some alleging the hominids were malformed, little-brained midgets, but braincase scans suggested otherwise. Although certainly not an ancestor of modern humans, Flores Man appeared to be a different species of human that had coexisted with anatomically modern humans for thousands of years.</string>

		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isn&apos;t Evolution random?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is probably no other statement which is a better indication that the arguer doesn&apos;t understand evolution. Chance certainly plays a large part in evolution, but this argument completely ignores the fundamental role of natural selection, and selection is the very opposite of chance. Chance, in the form of mutations, provides genetic variation, which is the raw material that natural selection has to work with. From there, natural selection sorts out certain variations. Those variations which give greater reproductive success to their possessors (and chance ensures that such beneficial mutations will be inevitable) are retained, and less successful variations are weeded out. When the environment changes, or when organisms move to a different environment, different variations are selected, leading eventually to different species. Harmful mutations usually die out quickly, so they don&apos;t interfere with the process of beneficial mutations accumulating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Nor is abiogenesis (the origin of the first life) due purely to chance. Atoms and molecules arrange themselves not purely randomly, but according to their chemical properties. In the case of carbon atoms especially, this means complex molecules are sure to form spontaneously, and these complex molecules can influence each other to create even more complex molecules. Once a molecule forms that is approximately self-replicating, natural selection will guide the formation of ever more efficient replicators. The first self-replicating object didn&apos;t need to be as complex as a modern cell or even a strand of DNA. Some self-replicating molecules are not really all that complex (as organic molecules go).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Some people still argue that it is wildly improbable for a given self-replicating molecule to form at a given point (although they usually don&apos;t state the &quot;givens,&quot; but leave them implicit in their calculations). This is true, but there were oceans of molecules working on the problem, and no one knows how many possible self-replicating molecules could have served as the first one. A calculation of the odds of abiogenesis is worthless unless it recognizes the immense range of starting materials that the first replicator might have formed from, the probably innumerable different forms that the first replicator might have taken, and the fact that much of the construction of the replicating molecule would have been non-random to start with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(One should also note that the theory of evolution doesn&apos;t depend on how the first life began. The truth or falsity of any theory of abiogenesis wouldn&apos;t affect evolution in the least.)</string>

		<string>Don&apos;t mutations cause problems?</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&apos;t mutations cause problems?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mutation is a change in DNA, the hereditary material of life. An organism’s DNA affects how it looks, how it behaves, and its physiology—all aspects of its life. So a change in an organism’s DNA can cause changes in all aspects of its life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mutations are random.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mutations can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful for the organism, but mutations do not “try” to supply what the organism “needs.” In this respect, mutations are random—whether a particular mutation happens or not is unrelated to how useful that mutation would be.&lt;br&gt;Not all mutations matter to evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;￼Since all cells in our body contain DNA, there are lots of places for mutations to occur; however, not all mutations matter for evolution. Somatic mutations occur in non-reproductive cells and won’t be passed onto offspring.&lt;br&gt;For example, the golden color on half of this Red Delicious apple was caused by a somatic mutation. The seeds of this apple do not carry the mutation. &lt;br&gt;The only mutations that matter to large-scale evolution are those that can be passed on to offspring. These occur in reproductive cells like eggs and sperm and are called germ line mutations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A single germ line mutation can have a range of effects:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	&lt;b&gt;1.  No change occurs in phenotype.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some mutations don&apos;t have any noticeable effect on the phenotype of an organism. This can happen in many situations: perhaps the mutation occurs in a stretch of DNA with no function, or perhaps the mutation occurs in a protein-coding region, but ends up not affecting the amino acid sequence of the protein. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	&lt;b&gt;2.  Small change occurs in phenotype.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;	 A single mutation caused this cat’s ears to curl backwards slightly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.  Big change occurs in phenotype.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some really important phenotypic changes, like DDT resistance in insects are sometimes caused by single mutations1. A single mutation can also have strong negative effects for the organism. Mutations that cause the death of an organism are called lethals—and it doesn&apos;t get more negative than that.&lt;br&gt;Mutation is a change in DNA, the hereditary material of life. An organism’s DNA affects how it looks, how it behaves, and its physiology—all aspects of its life. So a change in an organism’s DNA can cause changes in all aspects of its life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;Evolution is Change.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The foundation of evolution is not just working DNA, but changing DNA. The primary mechanism of significant change in DNA is mutation. That DNA is subject to mutation is a fact and it has been directly observed. In addition, many of the mechanisms of mutation are understood including mutations that can lead to drastic changes in an organism. This means we understand some of the mechanisms by which changes in an organism can be affected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All living organisms have in common those they posses genetic material that is subject to these mechanisms of change. What&apos;s more, we understand that the characteristics an organism possesses are determined by its genetic code — its genes are largely what make an organism what it is. These facts, that 1) DNA determines the nature of an organism and that 2) there are mechanisms through which DNA can be modified, are the basis of evolution. It is through these facts that evolution happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small Changes &amp; Large Changes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, given that DNA makes the organism what it is and DNA is subject to change it is reasonable that, through successive changes that are passed to successive offspring those large-scale changes in genetic code can take place over time. The only way this would not make sense is if some mechanism were identified which would prevent a sufficiently large accumulation of changes from happening. No such mechanism is known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, we have a mechanism for encoding the characteristics of a life form, a mechanism for this code to be changed, no known mechanism to definitively limit the amount of changes that can take place, and lots of time for changes to take place. The very basis of evolution, genetics, supports the idea that common descent is at least possible both biologically and logically.Mutations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key area of disagreement between creationists and evolutionists regarding genetic operation is that the creationists claim genetic change cannot go beyond a certain point. Usually there is no support offered for this position, but sometimes a case is made that mutations are generally detrimental to an organism, and that if too much change took place over time, the organism would not be viable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is open as to what percentage of mutations which actually affect the organism are likely to be detrimental or beneficial. The vast majorities of mutations are likely to be neutral or may even have no effect at all. However, it is clear that both detrimental and beneficial changes can take place. Furthermore, there are a variety of ways in which the effects of detrimental mutations can be mitigated, for example through sexual reproduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One problem with this debate is that creationists rely too heavily on a theoretical point that lacks any evidentiary support — which is ironic, given how much they complain about an alleged lack of evidence for evolution. Creationists theorize that changes over time must result in inviability of an organism (or sometimes that survival is so unlikely as to be equivalent to impossible). This is a &quot;magic line&quot; which cannot be crossed but which they cannot point to in any set of evidence or describe through any analytical model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mutations Aren&apos;t Always Harmful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evolutionists in contrast can point to empirical mechanisms that can allow organisms to survive with mutations. First, severely detrimental mutations would kill an organism or prevent it from passing on its genes. Second, currently living organisms do carry genes with detrimental mutations, and yet these organisms thrive. Given that evolution has had billions of years and many billions of organisms to work on (which would tend to weed out large-scale detrimental mutations), the &quot;unlikely&quot; survival of organisms with mutations doesn&apos;t seem so unlikely any more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus while the conclusion that extensive changes have occurred over time is based partially on inferences and an interpretation of data, the evolution side has strong evidence to support the idea that evolutionary development and common descent are both biologically and logically possible while creationists have nothing to demonstrate it is not possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is worth mentioning that anyone claiming that something is impossible has a much higher hurdle to jump than those who argue that something is possible.</string>

		<string>Aren&apos;t the chances of life forming 1 in a trillion?</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aren&apos;t the chances of life forming 1 in a trillion?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Creationists often claim that the chances of a modern enzyme forming by random means are astronomically small, and therefore the chances of a complete bacterium (which is composed of hundreds or thousands of such enzymes &amp; proteins) is so near to impossible that it would never happen in the 13 billion years or so since the universe took shape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The main problem with this argument is that it assumes abiogenesis (the initial formation of life from simpler molecules) was a totally random process. It also assumes that in order for abiogenesis to be successful, a complete microbe would have had to form spontaneously. In fact, the same non-random forces which propel biological evolution also propelled abiogenesis. Specifically, Natural Selection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The calculation which supports the creationist argument begins with the probability of a 300-molecule-long protein forming by total random chance. This would be approximately 1 chance in 10390. This number is astoundingly huge. By comparison, the number of all the atoms in the observable universe is 1080. So, if a simple protein has that unlikely chance of forming, what hope does a complete bacterium have? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If this were the theory of abiogeneisis, and if it relied entirely on random chance, then yes, it would be impossible for life to form in this way. However, this is not the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Abiogenesis was a long process with many small incremental steps, all governed by the non-random forces of Natural Selection and chemistry. The very first stages of abiogenesis were no more than simple self-replicating molecules, which might hardly have been called alive at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For example, the simplest theorized self-replicating peptide is only 32 amino acids long. The probability of it forming randomly, in sequential trials, is approximately 1 in 1040, which is much more likely than the 1 in 10390 claim creationists often cite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Though, to be fair, 1040 is still a very large number. It would still take an incredibly large number of sequential trials before the peptide would form. But remember that in the prebiotic oceans of the early Earth, there would be billions of trials taking place simultaneously as the oceans, rich in amino acids, were continuously churned by the tidal forces of the moon and the harsh weather conditions of the Earth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In fact, if we assume the volume of the oceans were 1024 liters, and the amino acid concentration was 10-6M (which is actually very dilute), then almost 1031 self-replicating peptides would form in under a year, let alone millions of years. So, even given the difficult chances of 1 in 1040, the first stages of abiogenesis could have started very quickly indeed.</string>

		<string>What is the Fossil Record?</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the fossil record?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remains of animals and plants found in sedimentary ￼ rock deposits give us an indisputable record of past changes through vast periods of time.  This evidence attests to the fact that there has been a tremendous variety of living things.  Some extinct species had traits that were transitional between major groups of organisms.  Their existence confirms that species are not fixed but can evolve into other species over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The evidence also shows that what have appeared to be gaps in the fossil record are due to incomplete data collection.  The more that we learn about the evolution of specific species lines, the more that these so-called gaps or &quot;missing links in the chain of evolution&quot; are filled with transitional fossil specimens.  One of the first of these gaps to be filled was between small bipedal dinosaurs and birds.  Just two years after Darwin published On the Origin of Species, a 150-145 million year old fossil of Archaeopteryx ￼ was found in southern Germany.  It had jaws with teeth and a long bony tail like dinosaurs, broad wings and feathers like birds, and skeletal features of both.  This discovery verified the assumption that birds had reptilian ancestors.
Since the discovery of Archaeopteryx, there have been many other crucial evolutionary gaps filled in the fossil record.  Perhaps, the most important one, from our human perspective, was that between apes and our own species.  Since the 1920&apos;s, there have been literally hundreds of well-dated intermediate fossils found in Africa that were transitional species leading from apes to humans over the last 6-7 million years.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The fossil record also provides abundant evidence that the complex animals and plants of today were preceded by earlier simple ones.  In addition, it shows that multicelled organisms evolved only after the first single-celled ones.  This fits the predictions of evolutionary theory.</string>

		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why aren&apos;t there more Transitional Fossils?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only a minute fraction of organisms that die end up as fossils; most of them decay or are eaten by scavengers fairly soon after they die. To become a fossil you must die and very soon be covered up in a way that will preserve at least some of you (or your tracks). Of course getting fossilized is only a part of the story. Once you have been buried, your preserved parts, which generally undergo a process of mineralization (having tissues replaced with minerals, making you into a rock), have to be found before the rock you are in gets eroded away or subducted into the Earth&apos;s magma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Now suppose that you are a member of a fairly small transitional population. The chances that you will end up in a museum display as an example of a transitional fossil are extremely small. In fact, it is somewhat surprising that we have as many transitional fossils as we do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Despite the odds against it, evolutionary scientists have found and described numerous examples of fossils that share traits of what are now considered to be distinct and different types of organisms—transitional fossils. The classic example of this is Archaeopteryx, a fossil specimen that has features of both dinosaurs and modern birds. In fact, several of the fossils remains were classified as small dinosaurs until the discovery of specimens with clear impressions of feathers—feathers that were clearly attached to the specimen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Anti-evolutionists sometimes admit that some transitional fossils exist, but this is admitting to evolution. It only takes one transitional fossil sequence to demonstrate that evolution can happen.</string>

		<string>Did we evolve from monkeys?</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did we evolve from monkeys?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Humans did not evolve from monkeys, nor did they evolve from chimpanzees or any other type of primate extant today. Animals alive today are not the same animals that existed when humans were first appearing in the fossil record. The ancestors of what one would call a monkey today would not have not looked very monkey-like 30 million years ago; more importantly, not only wouldn&apos;t it look very much like a monkey, but it wasn&apos;t a monkey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All animals are in a constant process of change, and each generation of animals is slightly different than the previous generation. Since humans are visual beings, it&apos;s important for most to be able to visualize in order to conceptualize. Since we know that humans and monkeys are related, many deduce that because humans and monkeys are related, and since we are not monkeys and we must have had come from somewhere, that logically we came from monkeys. A key concept to understand is that present-day monkeys are just as new to the Earth as you are. They did not &apos;come first&apos; and we did not &apos;come after them&apos;. They are in their own process of evolution just as every other animal and organism is, from chimpanzees and gorillas, to crocodilians, snakes, and bacteria and viruses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All primates alive today evolved from arboreal mammals that looked something like present-day lemurs (though they were not lemurs). As millennia passed genetic changes occurred, both detrimental changes that could, and possibly did, kill the animal (e.g. cancers), and beneficial changes that improved the animal (e.g. fifth digit becoming opposable). Not all genetic changes are passed on to the next generation. In order to be passed on, the change must be &apos;recorded&apos; in one of the reproductive cells; only then is the mutation hereditary, and even then the mutation may not be expressed unless the correct conditions are met. In order for the mutation to be beneficial, it must improve the animal to its environment. A mutation that suddenly replaces lungs with gills in a land animal would spell certain death for that animal; though not an inherently detrimental mutation in itself, in the environment the land animal lives in it would have been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As the genetic changes accrued the animals began to change. Eyes began to move from the side of the head to the front of the head. Those animals who&apos;s offspring&apos;s eyes were not positioned in front of the head could not survive as easily and died out. Craniums were becoming larger. Those animals that had smaller brains could not survive as easily and died out. Many different evolutionary paths, many different family trees, were forming. Some animals became larger. Some became smaller. The animals that remained small tended to live in trees more than on land because their weight allowed them the luxury. The animals that grew larger tended to live more on land than in the trees, because living in the trees was more physically strenuous, and because living on land offered resources that the trees did not provide. Eventually, those animals that lived on land learned, due partially to an ever larger evolving brain, that objects in nature could be used and manipulated to affect other objects in nature, and the first artificial tools came to being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;Did humans evolve from monkeys?&quot; Just as humans did not evolve from monkeys, they did not evolve from chimpanzees either. Both humans and chimpanzees are evolving from a common ancestor, which itself evolved from one branch of the many branches of the family of now extinct arboreal mammals that looked something like present-day lemurs (though, again, they were not lemurs). Evolutionists and anthropologists are still learning facts and uncovering fossils of human ancestors, and eventually we may have a mostly complete fossil record showing our evolution from the first mammals that survived after the extinction 65 million years ago to us now in the present day.</string>

		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why are there still apes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Scientists have been trying to explain for over a century that humans did not evolve from apes. Rather, humans and apes share an ancient, common ancestor. This common ancestor is now extinct.  Unfortunately, there are individuals who have promoted creation science and spread confusion by misrepresenting the theory of evolution.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

However, the question comes from a flawed understanding of how evolution works. Evolution is not a straight line, where entire populations change into new species all at the same time. Often times, a small group breaks away from a population and begins to evolve independently of the source group. The source group does not need to go extinct, and is generally unaffected by the development of the smaller group.  This is called &quot;Allopatric Speciation,&quot; and it is just one of many ways that new species can evolve. There is nothing in evolutionary theory which states a source population must go extinct in order for new species to evolve.</string>

Since the earliest hominid species diverged from the ancestor we share with modern African apes, 5 to 8 million years ago, there have been at least a dozen different species of these humanlike creatures. Many of these hominid species are close relatives, but not human ancestors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Most went extinct without giving rise to other species. Some of the extinct hominids known today, however, are almost certainly direct ancestors of Homo sapiens. While the total number of species that existed and the relationships among them is still unknown, the picture becomes clearer as new fossils are found. Humans evolved through the same biological processes that govern the evolution of all life on Earth.</string>

Radiocarbon dating is just one of many &quot;radiometric&quot; dating techniques. While contamination in the laboratory might happen on rare occasions, radiometric dating remains a trusted and reliable method of determining the age of a sample. The technique relies on the constant rate of decay of certain radioactive elements in the sample. For example, rubidium-strontium dating relies on the decay of rubidium-87 to strontium-87. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rubidium-87 has a half-life of 50 million years (the amount of time for half its mass to decay into strontium). Using this figure, scientists measure the amount of rubidium and strontium in a sample to determine its age.</string>

		<string>What is Intelligent Design?</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is intelligent design?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A concept known as &quot;intelligent design&quot; (ID) has been used as an argument against Darwinism from the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859 right up to the present day. Quite simply, ID states that living organisms must be the product of careful and conscious design, so perfectly formed that they cannot be explained by the random workings of evolution alone. Modern ID theorists contend that this is a new and novel scientific alternative to evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

ID, however, has been rejected by the modern scientific community for the same reasons that it failed in the 19th century. When closely examined, the living world is filled with evidence that complex organisms not only could have evolved through evolution&apos;s trial-and-error mechanism, but must have done so, because their structure, their physiology, and even their genetic makeup are all inconsistent with the demands of intelligent design.</string>

		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there evidence for intelligent design?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No, there is nothing that supports Intelligent Design.  Many people believe Intelligent Design must be the answer because of how complex we have become.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There exist marvelous and intricate adaptations in living things to perform complex functions. Take birds, for example. The feathers have a complex structure ideally adapted for the aerodynamics of flight. The bones are hollow to provide strength and light weight. An airplane created by human beings requires intelligent design to construct it and make it fly. The &quot;intelligent design&quot; position is that since an airplane requires intelligent design, the anatomy of a bird also must have been designed.
Intelligent design proponents believe that evolution can not explain the complexity of living things, and therefore it is merely a belief, regardless of the amount of scientific evidence. Evolution is based on two concepts: (1) Present life forms are descended from primitive ancestors, and (2) the process was guided by natural selection. In order to lend any credence to their theory of intelligent design, its supporters must establish that natural selection rules out any possibility of a designer. They have not done this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The intelligent design theory is based on the assumption that natural selection requires that living things came into existence by mere chance alone. There is absolutely no scientific basis for this belief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Intelligent design proponents use the fallacious argument that the &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; of functions in living things proves that they could not have evolved from previously non-existent structures. A bird cannot fly without hollow bones, avian wing structure, and feathers. Take away any of these components, and flight is impossible. Intelligent design theory is based on the assumption that all these components evolved simultaneously from a single set of mutations. According to ID, the mathematical probability that they all evolved simultaneously to produce flight is essentially zero. Therefore, according to ID theory, an intelligent deity must have purposely designed the bird.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
ID supporters use the analogy of a mousetrap: take away any part and it ceases to function. It ceases to function as a mousetrap, but that doesn&apos;t mean that it has no function at all. Remove the latching wire, and it can still function as a memo holder or a tie clip. In the case of birds, fossil evidence indicates that a reptile mutation produced pinnate scales. Through a process of natural selection, the scales became feathers. After feathers evolved, front legs evolved to wing structures. Further down the line, natural selection favored birds with hollow bones. There is no basis for the ID &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; theory that they all would have had to evolve simultaneously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In their presentations, intelligent design proponents stress that living things are perfectly designed for their purpose, with no potentially useful parts created by mutation. The evidence does not support this idea that mutations never create any useful modifications. It has been shown that bacteria that have components with no useful function can use that function to advantage under different environmental conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Like their bedfellows the biblical creationists, intelligent design supporters present no evidence to support their position. Instead, they resort to negative attacks on evolutionary science based on distortions, misquotes, and outright falsehoods.

		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isn&apos;t Evolution just another religion that requires faith?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.  A religion is a set of beliefs based on the supernatural, which by definition is untestable and impossible to disprove (or &quot;unfalsifiable&quot;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Faith, in the religious sense, can be stated as &quot;belief without evidence.&quot;  No aspect of science works this way, including the Theory of Evolution.  All scientific theories have been scrutinized through years of experimentation, and can all be falsifiable.  For example, the Theory of Gravity can be proven false if a scientist can devise an experiment where two bodies did not attract each other.  Likewise, the Theory of Evolution could be proven false if a scientist ever documents the evolution of a new adaptation to an organism which did not in any way benefit the organism&apos;s ability to survive, reproduce, or ensure the survival of its species as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

While scientists may place faith in a scientific theory, their faith is based on past evidence.  For example, all scientists have faith that the Law of Thermodynaics will hold true during an experiment because there is overwhelming past evidence to support this belief.  This is completely different than placing faith in a religious belief, which has no supporting evidence at all.</string>

		<string>If the sun is losing diameter, it would have been too big.</string>

		<string>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;If the sun is losing 5ft in diamter every hour, wouldn&apos;t it have been too big billions of years ago?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This argument comes from a paper published in 1979 by astronomer John Eddy. After studying observations from 1836 through the 20th century, he found the sun had contracted 2 arc seconds. He had found proof of what atronomers had suspected and know for a fact today: that the sun&apos;s diameter oscillates in an 80 year cycle. It does not constantly shrink. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Within the sun, and every star, there are 2 opposing forces: the intense gravity of the star, trying to crush it, and the intense heat of nuclear fusion, trying to blow it apart. As the gravitational field causes the surface to shrink ever so slightly, it builds incredible pressure inside the star, which speeds up the fusion reactions (think of a pressure cooker). The increased fusion then pushes the surface back out again, and the cycle starts over. Because the sun is truly gigantic, about 1 million times the size of Earth, this cycle plays out on what we would consider a slow scale: every 80 years.</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Why can&apos;t atheists just let people believe?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Believers having faith in general isn’t necessarily a bad thing in itself. But belief isn’t always a good thing. The problem comes when that faith leads to political decisions that discriminate against people your religious leaders don’t agree with. Every religious doctrine is antiquated, and written in the mind of an archaic culture by people with less morality than our society currently accepts. That’s why faith in these beliefs leads to a regression in our society; preventing medical discoveries by blocking stem cell research, encouraging suppression by keeping women in lesser positions without power, continuing oppression by blocking marriage equality, and forcing young women to give birth to children they don’t want and can’t take care of by blocking a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. It gets even more dangerous when faithful parents “treat” their sick child with prayer, only to have the child die. Rather than calling it neglect, we call it religious freedom? Faith can be very deadly if not challenged, and even more deadly when it influences governments. That’s why we do what we do.

My ignorance is not your evidence. My lack of proof against your version of god is not proof of your god’s existence, any more than your lack of proof against my invisible garden fairies means I actually have them. Besides, you don’t know Krishna isn’t the one true god, and that Jesus isn’t the false prophet all the religions warned us about. You can only believe it to be true, but you can’t know it.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Why are so many people Christians if it’s not true?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First, there are more people on earth that aren’t Christians, than are. Second, since when have “the masses” ever made sound decisions? And third, religions are more like languages than facts. They depend on where you’re from, when you’re born, and the things your parents say. Atheism is the realization that none of them have proof.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Evil happens because we have Free Will.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Is there free will in heaven? Do bad things happen in heaven? The point is, you can have multiple choices without one being horrific. For example, hockey referees allow players to push, grab, and even punch other players. But if one tried to take off a skate and stab someone, they would stop that from happening. It would appear that hockey refs have a greater morality than the god of the bible. 
The fact that so many Christians believe an ancient woman ate a fruit, thereby justifying children suffering and dying from cancer is astonishing. And even more amazing, you claim that the being in charge of the entire universe, watching this happen, actually has superior morality and will one day hold me accountable simply for not believing all this to be true.

In the bible, Satan was in heaven with God, and still turned against him. So evidently, even ‘knowing’ that a particular god exists doesn’t force one to worship. That’s the beauty of free will.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;What if you’re wrong? Isn’t it safer to just believe? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I could attend your church, and go through the motions. I could shake the hands, sing the songs, and help with the luncheons. But that wouldn’t make me a believer. It would only make me a pretender. Belief isn’t a choice one makes, it’s a realization one comes to after evaluating evidence. Try to walk in a dark close in the middle of the day and force yourself to believe it’s night time. Or better yet, climb on top of a building, look over the edge, and try not to believe in gravity. When faced with a question, your mind comes to a conclusion based on your physical brain matter, neurological activity, psychology, critical thinking, learned behaviors, and the environment in which you were raised. You have very little control over what you believe, but you have complete control over what information you take in and block out. Remaining willfully ignorant is a far-greater disservice to one’s own life experience.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Jesus died for you. How can you not believe in him?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We often hear that God gave his “only begotten son” and that Jesus sacrificed his life for us. But let’s think this through. In the Christian belief, we learn 3 major things: 1) God is eternal, so he has existed for billions of years; 2) everything that happens is according to his will and his plan, and 3) Jesus is God in human form. So when we say he “sacrificed” his “life,” what we really mean is, a powerful being that existed for billions of years and has complete control over the universe, came to earth according to his own plan, died for 3 days, came back to life, and floated to paradise where he exists for billions of years more. And we call this a sacrifice? If I let you have my house for 3 days and then kicked you out, I could hardly say I “sacrificed” my home to you. As a Christian, if you believe Jesus is in heaven (either being God, or with God) how can you also believe that God sacrificed his son for you? Doesn’t he have him back in your belief?

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Jesus resurrected and ascended to heaven. He’s obviously God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We don’t know Jesus died and came back to life. What we do know, is that someone wrote that down over 2,000 years ago in a language most of us can’t read, on fragmented papyrus that we only have pieces of. It’s not that I don’t have faith in Jesus. I just don’t have enough faith in the scribes who wrote the stories down to know if they are true or not. Besides, of the 4 Gospels, the first one (Mark) never mentions that Jesus ascended to heaven. Matthew and John also didn’t bother to mention it. Luke, which was one of the later Gospels, is the only one who says that Jesus ascended into heaven. And if his body did resurrect, he was of flesh and bone, not a spirit. And if his physical body ascended upward, where did it go? Isn’t heaven a spiritual place? How could a physical body exist in a spiritual place? Besides, not a single person who wrote anything in the Bible ever actually walked with Jesus or talked with him directly. The earliest possible writing about Jesus came 40 years after his alleged death, and the Bible itself wasn’t completed as a whole book until 325 years after the story of Jesus’ crucifixion. It’s much more likely that the story of Jesus came from earlier religions which had a ‘Redeemer’ that died for all mankind.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Jesus was born of a virgin, which has to be a miracle. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the original text, the author used the Hebrew word ‘almah’ to refer to Mary. This word actually meant ‘young maiden’ and was sometimes used to refer to virgins. It wasn’t until the Greek translation, that scribes used the term ‘parthemos’ which strictly means virgin. So we’re not even sure the original author intended to describe Mary as a virgin, yet the entire basis of Christianity rests upon this assumption. The most surprising thing about this story is, according to Mathew 1:20, the entire idea of Mary becoming impregnated by God was just a dream Joseph had! No other person can confirm this story because it happened in Joseph’s brain while he was sleeping. According to Jewish Law in those times, (taken from the Bible) if it was discovered that a young woman was pregnant without being married, she was stoned to death, or at best, banished from the city. So Joseph coming up with a dream that God got his girlfriend pregnant, is really ingenious, but hardly divine intervention.

Is Jesus the son of God, or the human incarnation of God? When he ascended into heaven in physical form, did he become God again, or are God and Jesus separate entities in heaven today? Is heaven a spiritual place or a physical place? Was Jesus just a man that was embodied by the Holy Spirit, making him the same as God? Or did Jesus say “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God the Father?” The answer is... yes to all of these. And that’s why there are 41,000 denominations of Christianity.

		<string>Atheism is a religion</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;b&gt;Atheism is a religion&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atheism is not a religion. Religion implies belief. Atheism, by its very nature, is lack of belief. If you take the word apart, you get a- theism. “Theism” means religion, and the prefix “a-“ means absence, not opposition. For example, an asexual person (“a-sexual”) is one who isn’t interested in sex, not one who hates or opposes sex.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is another example: let’s assume you don’t believe in unicorns. That would make you an aunicornist – a-unicorn-ist. (I apologize for this linguistic atrocity, but it’s the best I’ve got.) If you actively and vehemently denied the existence of unicorns all the time and preached that unicorns are a lie, you’d be an anti-unicornist. Do you see the difference?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religions have many common characteristics. For example, Muslims face Mecca when they pray, don’t eat pork, and believe that Allah was a prophet. Christians read the Bible and believe in the existence of God, the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ. On the other hand, pretty much the only thing atheists have in common is that they don’t believe in God. There are no ritual rites for becoming an atheist, there are no secret handshakes and there is no worldwide atheist conspiracy to destroy Christmas, no matter how much FOX News talks about it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, if you (or the people you’re debating) are still not convinced that atheism is not a religion – fine, let’s assume that it is. In that case, that would mean atheism is the oldest religion in the world. After all, it’s safe to assume that whenever the first cavemen invented their first religion, there must have been at least one caveman (cavewoman?) who had his or her doubts about the whole thing. Religions come and go, but doubt and skepticism are eternal. The world’s oldest religions go back “only” 5,000- 10,000 years, but if atheism is in fact a religion, then it’s at least 10 times as
old. Seniority means authority, and if lack of belief outlasted most of the beliefs out there, maybe atheists are onto something after all.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If atheism is a religion, then bald is a hair color and not collecting stamps is a hobby.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Atheism is the absence of belief in a god.  Just like a christian doesn&apos;t believe in gods like Zeus and Thor.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Evolution is just a &lt;i&gt;Theory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually, there is a world of difference between the layman’s “theory” and scientific theory. If you say “I’ve got a theory about that missing iPod,” you’ll be using the word in a colloquial sense. The theory of evolution is a scientific theory, which means it’s a hypothesis that’s got a lot of facts supporting it and that can be tested over and over. Gravity is “just a theory” too, but you don’t see people jumping off cliffs to disprove it, do you?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientific theories are not created on a whim by a bored researcher who wants to push his own evil secular agenda – quite the contrary. A theory begins with an observation. Then a hypothesis is formed and tested, time and again. If the hypothesis in question holds up and if experiments produce consistent results over and over, the hypothesis becomes a theory.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is an example. Observation: slow gazelles get eaten by lions. Hypothesis: fast and healthy gazelles are more likely to survive and reproduce than slower, less healthy gazelles. Experiment: tag a group of wild gazelles and observe (preferably from a very safe distance) them getting chased by lions. If you conduct the experiment enough times and confirm your hypothesis, you’ll be able to upgrade it to a theory: animals that can avoid predators, due to either speed or some other adaptation, survive and reproduce. This example is grossly simplified, but it conveys the essence of scientific method and the kind of work a scientist needs to do to produce a theory.</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Atheism has no basis for Morality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The absolute morality which a religious person might profess, stoning people for adultery, death for apostasy, punishment for breaking the sabbath.  These are all things which are religiously based absolute moralities.  I don&apos;t think I want an absolute morality, I think I want a morality that is thought out, reasoned, argued, discussed and based upon, you can almost say, intelligent design. 

Can we not design our society, which has the sort of morality we want to live in.  If you actually look at the moralities that our accepted amount modern people, 21st century people.

We don&apos;t believe in slavery anymore, we believe in equality of women, we believe in being gentle, we believe in being kind to animals.  These are all things that are entirely recent. 

 We have very little basis in biblical or qur&apos;anic scripture, they are things that are developed over historical time through a consensus of reasoning, sober discussion, argument, legal theory, political and moral philosophy.  These do not come from religion, to the extent that you can find the good bits in religious scripts, you have to cherry pick.  You search your way through the bible or Qur&apos;an and you find the occasional verse that is an acceptable profession of morality and you say &quot;Look at that, that&apos;s religion&quot; and you leave out all the horrible bits and you say &quot;Oh we don&apos;t believe that anymore, we&apos;ve grown out of it&quot;  Well of course we&apos;ve grown out of it, we&apos;ve grown out of it because of secular moral philosophy and rational discussion.&quot;

If you took a month off and prayed to the Flying Spaghetti Monster, your prayers would be answered exactly the same amount as if you were praying to your god.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;So what are some things you might do instead of praying?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- If you want to get a better grade on that test, instead of praying for God&apos;s help, why not just study more?  Find other resources, take some sample tests, or find a study partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- If you want to help someone who is sick, go and visit them in the hospital, send flowers,  or contribute money to research for whatever disease it is that they are afflicted with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- If you want to help people who have just had their homes destroyed in a hurricane you can donate money to the Red Cross or some other relief agency, or consider getting in your car and driving down there to volunteer in some way. God isn&apos;t going to rebuild those homes, it will require people to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- If you want to lose weight then get up off the sofa and exercise. You&apos;ve got two legs, use them. Change your diet, eat healthier foods, get the proper amount of rest, or stop smoking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- If you need advice or an answer to question then ask another human, read a book, search on the internet, or meditate on it (that&apos;s all prayer is anyway).

		<string>Lack of historical evidence for Jesus</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;b&gt;Lack of Historical Evidence for Jesus&apos;s Existence:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. Jesus wrote nothing. &lt;br/&gt; 2. The Gospels were written at least 60 years after Jesus&apos;s death. &lt;br/&gt; 3. The writers of the Gospels were not Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John; they were anonymous. &lt;br/&gt; 4. There are no writings from historians of the time about Jesus outside of the Christian writings. &lt;br/&gt; 5. Different accounts in the Gospels of the same stories of Jesus contain discrepancies. &lt;br/&gt; 6. Stories of god-men, virgin births, and resurrection were common at the time of Jesus. &lt;br/&gt; 7. There were other self-proclaimed Messiahs of Jesus&apos;s time who performed miracles. &lt;br/&gt; When considering the above seven facts, it can lead us to conclude Jesus may have been a mythological figure. Let&apos;s look at each point in detail.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;1. Jesus wrote nothing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 There are no known writings from Jesus himself. The words written in red, in the King James Bible, the words of Jesus, are what he was &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to have said. If he existed, he was probably illiterate since his parents were poor peasants; only the wealthy elite could write at the time. Other self-proclaimed messiahs of the time wrote things. Theologian Robert Price, in the documentary &quot;the God who wasn&apos;t there,&quot; states, &quot;We know Apollonius of Tyana existed, not only because he wrote things-other historians wrote about him.&quot; The gospels also contain no physical description of Jesus. There are no sculptures or paintings of Jesus from during his lifetime. We have plenty from Emperors as well as other famous philosophers.&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;/page&gt;
            &lt;page title=&quot;Lack of Evidence for Jesus - two&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lack of evidence for Jesus - page 2.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;2/3. The Gospels were written at least 60 years after Jesus&apos;s supposed death.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 The Gospels are the only four books out of 27 in the New Testament about the life of the supposed Son of God. According to Chapel Hill University Professor of religious studies Bart Ehrman, the books of the Bible containing the stories of Jesus were untitled and written anonymously between 60 and 90 A.D. The names Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John did not appear until later copies-at least 100 years later, in the 2nd century. The authors of the Gospels did not live during Jesus&apos;s time; therefore, they &lt;u&gt;could not&lt;/u&gt; have witnessed Jesus speaking or his miracles. They did not know Jesus. The stories were passed down by storytelling oral tradition. All of the things he is supposed to have said were written down 50-120 years after his death. The Gospels do not claim to be eyewitness accounts. &lt;br/&gt;
 (Notice the books are written in the third person: &quot;The Gospel according to Mathew.&quot;) &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Why would the writers lie about the authors&apos; names&lt;/u&gt; ? &lt;br/&gt;
 The act of attributing false authorship to an ancient text is known as Pseudepigraphy. Ehrman explains in ancient times this was very common practice for several reasons: (a) If a document was said to have been written by an apostle or a famous philosopher like Plato, people would read it. Though somewhat deceptive, it was an effective way to get a philosophy of text read by the public. (b) Profit motive: libraries would pay money for scrolls written by famous authors. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;4. There are no writings from historians of the time&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 There is no evidence outside of the Christian writings to show that Jesus even existed. There are many writings from historians of the time; none wrote about a man named Jesus. Jesus supposedly shook up Rome, and was said to be the Son of God, but no one wrote about him except for the Christians? There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one small mention in the writings of a Jewish Rabbi Josephus, but it is widely considered by Christian and Jewish historians alike to be a forgery. There is no mention of Jesus by the many historians of the day. Anyone important was written about. Was Jesus unimportant? &lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;/page&gt;
            &lt;page title=&quot;Lack of Evidence for Jesus - three&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lack of evidence for Jesus - page 3.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;5. There are discrepancies in the stories of Jesus&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Copies of copies of copies of copies&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 Currently, there are approximately 5,400 copies of ancient manuscripts from the New Testament known to be in existence. We do not have any of the original texts from the New Testament. All we have are copies that were copied from copies of copies, mostly by monks, starting from the 2nd century all the way up to the 16th century. &lt;u&gt;No two copies are alike&lt;/u&gt; . Since they were copied by hand, all of the manuscripts have many mistakes. Error-riddled copies of the originals is all we have. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Why are there discrepancies&lt;/u&gt; ? &lt;br/&gt;
 From the beginning of Christianity, before they were written down, stories were passed around by oral tradition, for at least 35 years. They were embellished, added to, or changed, depending on the storyteller. This is what humans do when we tell stories! When Christianity began to get popular, the stories were finally written down; there were different books with different versions of the same stories. They were translated from Aramaic to Greek, and to Hebrew, and eventually into English. There were many misunderstandings of context and mistakes in vocabulary when the scribes translated. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Scribes changed the originals when making copies&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 We know that scribes and early Christians changed the text when they were copying. How? Because we can compare them. There are texts from the 4th century in which we can see, when compared to later copies of the same text, that whole lines are changed, paragraphs are invented and inserted or omitted, in order to make more sense. Since we have multiple yet different versions of the same stories, we know that Christians changed the stories when they copied them. &lt;br/&gt;
 Professor of Theology at Johnnie Colemon Theological Seminary Robert Price points out, with regard to the last twelve verses of &quot;Mark&quot; 16:9-20 and &quot;John&quot; 8:3-11, that none of these verses is found in any early manuscript, but were added centuries later. (We have full versions of these manuscripts from the 4th century with which to compare.) Most translations other than KJV have those verses in italics, explaining those passages come from a later addition. Check your Bibles. &lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;6. Other gods, god-men, virgin birth, and resurrection stories&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Virgin birth&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 The concept of a man being the son of a god, born to a virgin was a common theme at the time of Jesus and before. Julius Caesar and Alexander the great (350 B.C.E.), both were said to have been the result of virgin births. In the story of Romulus and Remus, the mythological founders of Rome around 700 B.C.E., they were supposedly birthed by a Vestal Virgin. &lt;br/&gt;
 (Matthew and Luke are the only Christian writings to mention a virgin birth. Neither the letters of Paul nor the Gospels of Mark or John ever mentions Jesus&apos;s virgin birth) &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mithraism&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 The God Mithras, born of a virgin on December 25, shared a final meal with followers before ascending into heaven, being resurrected, and returning to Earth as the Son of God. Mithraism was at one time more popular than Christianity, especially among the Roman military. Bread and wine were used in a ritual to signify the body and blood of Mithras. No one knows if the Christian communion or Mithras ritual came first. The celebration of the winter solstice, December 21st, otherwise known as the celebration of the day the sun was born, was taken over by the Christians. &lt;br/&gt;
 (Mithraism was a Pagan religion competing with Christianity in ancient Rome up until the 4th century C.E., when Christianity took over as the official state religion and outlawed it.) &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Isis&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 The worship of Isis is one of the oldest religions, starting in Egypt around 2000 B.C.E. This religion offered a personal relationship with God very much like Christianity. Isis was the mother of the God Horus and was called the &quot;Virgin Mother of God&quot; and &quot;Holy Mother of God. &quot; The Catholic picture of the virgin mother Mary holding Jesus bears an extremely close resemblance to the drawings and statues in Egypt of Isis holding her son, Horus. Around 500 C.E. the worship of Isis as well as other pagan religions were banned, and temples then were converted to Christian places of worship. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;God-men&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 The idea that a god impregnates a human woman and she bears a son who is a son of god and has powers was a very common theme before and after Jesus&apos;s time. In Greek mythology, the god Zeus impregnated princess Danae and had god-man Perseus. Hercules was a god-man, whose father was Zeus but who had a mortal mother, Alcmena. The Greek god Dionysos was also fathered by Zeus, who impregnated a mortal woman. Krishna is worshiped as a god-man, a supreme being who was human in form, died, and ascended into heaven. &lt;br/&gt;
 Tiberius, Emperor of Rome at the same time of Jesus, was called the Son of God. In fact, all the emperors for centuries were considered divine and were to be worshiped as divine. &lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;7. Other self-proclaimed messiahs&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 The early Christian sects were looking for a messiah. During the first three centuries, there were many different co-existing Christian sects, all competing for their version of Christianity to be accepted. Self-proclaimed messiahs like Jesus were common; some had many followers and also performed miracles. We know the following men existed because they either wrote, themselves, or were written about by historians in their lifetimes: &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Apollonius of Tyana (same time period as Jesus)&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Pagan philosopher, healer, exorcist, also had a miraculous birth. He had many followers, preached peace and love, healed the sick, raised the dead, and ascended into heaven by a heavenly choir, but unlike Jesus, Apollonius wrote and had things written about him by historians. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Simon Magus of Simeria (same time)&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Performed miracles and had a large following from Egypt to Rome. The Bible actually mentions Simon, and quite negatively (Acts, chapter 8), referring to him as a sorcerer, probably because he was considered a strong and dangerous rival to the Jesus story. Simon claimed to &quot;be&quot; the power of God. He was accompanied by a woman named Helena (formerly a prostitute). He lived around the time of Jesus, but he was worshiped as God and savior up until 300 C.E. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Simon bar Kochba (130 C.E.)&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Simon bar Kochba was said to be descended from the royal family of King David-just like Jesus. He spoke out against and wanted to fight Rome. Many believed he was the true Messiah. Simon bar Kochba built an army and started a rebellion against Rome, which turned into a war. He freed Jerusalem from Roman occupation and was able to hold it for several years. &quot;Simon the Messiah&quot; was engraved on coins. Simon was the kind of messiah the early Christians were expecting. A savior who is of royal bloodline and a powerful military leader, who could defeat Rome. Not the weak Jesus character who preaches peace and gets captured and killed by the Romans. Simon bar Kochba was defeated in 135 C.E. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Additional points&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Hades and Hell&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 In Greek mythology, mortals were judged after death and, if found guilty, they were sent to Hades, the underworld. The Greek idea of Hades and judgment predates Christianity. Yet, the New Testament uses the term Hell interchangeably with Hades. Hercules and Jesus both are said to have descended into Hell. Christianity did not invent the idea of Hell.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;The King Herod massacre is likely a fiction&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 The book of Mathew describes King Herod ordering all male children in Bethlehem under the age of two years to be killed, in order to kill the baby Jesus; he feared he could lose his throne to the &quot;King of the Jews.&quot; Though Herod was a brutal murderer, there is no evidence of this event. Most scholars agree, if the event were true, historians of the time would have written about it. (This is very similar to the story of Moses: The Pharaoh of Egypt ordered all the firstborn to be killed. Moses is hidden in a basket in the bulrushes.) &lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;Conclusion: Evidence is weak, and Jesus&apos;s story is not unique&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 Jesus may have existed. However, the supposed &lt;i&gt;Son of God&lt;/i&gt; wrote nothing. Those who wrote about him did not witness his speeches or know him-how accurate can that be? No historians wrote about him. We don&apos;t know who the original authors of the Christian texts were. All the writings have been changed from the original texts, and there are mistakes and fabrications. There were many similar religions and stories similar to that of Jesus that predate the Jesus story. Did the Christians copy the ideas from earlier religions? It appears they could have. There were other Messiahs that we actually &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have evidence for. The Jesus story really isn&apos;t that special when we look at all of the other god stories of the time. &lt;br/&gt;

		<string>&lt;b&gt;If you don’t believe in hell, what’s keeping you from going on a killing spree?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just because I’m an atheist, doesn’t mean I’m a hyper-aggressive caveman. I don’t have violent urges that would compel me to take natural selection into my own hands, and besides – if there is no afterlife, then this is all we get. As Joss Whedon put it, “If nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do.” In other words, if this is the only life we’ll ever get and if there are no tearful reunions with your loved ones in the afterlife, we get only one chance to get this right. There are no second chances, no take- backs, nothing but here and now: all that really matters is you, your loved ones and the choices you make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When it comes to the “axe murderer” accusation – why on earth would I want to deprive other people of their lives and spend my one and only life in prison? Conversely, does this mean that the only thing keeping religious people from going postal is their fear of hell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Secular humanists are a great bunch of people who derive their morality from, well, secular sources – I suggest doing some reading on them if you want to learn more about non-believers and their morality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</string>

It used to be a religious belief that the Earth was in the center of the universe and the Sun rotated around us.   Science was able to prove religion wrong in this one. 

&quot;Believing things without reason or evidence is a mark of idiocy, gullibility and ignorance&quot;

Some things are unanswerable, or not answered yet.  That doesn&apos;t mean that god is the answer.  It just means we need to do more research or develop more technology to make new discoveries.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Why do atheists bother getting up in the morning?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because we can&apos;t reach the &amp;@#! alarm clock! 

Ahem.

In a nutshell, what this question really implies is that the questioner believes that all meaning in life comes from God. If you don&apos;t believe in God, therefore, your life can have no meaning, so why bother? 

Let&apos;s turn the question around, however, and see how it sounds then. &quot;If as a Christian your whole goal in life is to die and get to Heaven, why wait? Just off yourself now and cut out all those pointless years of mortal existence.&quot; I can hear the spluttering now, but the original question is just as silly to an atheist as this one is to a Christian. 

Atheists find meaning in all kinds of things. We have families to feed, bills to pay, causes to advance, friends to see, lessons to learn, achievements to attain, and mountains to climb, just like theists do. Giving meaning to something yourself, instead of having it imposed by a &quot;higher power&quot;, doesn&apos;t make that meaning less real. Is the love someone feels for a spouse they themselves chose less powerful than the love someone feels for a spouse their parents chose for them in an arranged marriage? Does it matter that the feeling is self-assigned rather than other-assigned? As long as it&apos;s sincere, it doesn&apos;t seem to me that one is better than the other. Just different.</string>

		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;b&gt;Aren&apos;t science and atheism the same thing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, science and atheism are two completely different things. Someone can be a scientist and be an atheist or a theist of any sort. There are Christian scientists, Hindu scientists, Muslim scientists, atheist scientists. Science doesn&apos;t say anything one way or another about metaphysical issues (subjects having to do with the supernatural, or ideas that are not based in a physical universe); it is concerned solely and exclusively with that which is natural.
Most atheists subscribe to metaphysical naturalism, the idea that the natural world is all there is, period. Scientists subscribe to methodological naturalism, the idea that when trying to figure out how things work, only natural phenomena should be considered. Conflating the two is an error. One can be a scientist, employing methodological naturalism to figure out why volcanoes erupt (weak spots in the mantle allow deep magma to surge to the surface, not &quot;Baal is angry with us&quot;) while being, say, a Christian (God created the world such that the mantle has weak spots in it that allow magma to surge to the surface). The two are similar, but different, and conflating the proponents of one with the proponents of the other is a mistake.

Implying that science is the same thing as atheism is like saying &quot;Muslims believe lightning is a natural force, not bolts from an angry god. Science also believes lightning is a natural force, not bolts from an angry god, therefore science is Muslim in nature.&quot; Or put another way, it&apos;s the error of thinking that because set A and set B have subset C in common, set A equals set B.</string>

Seriously, most atheists would answer this question with &quot;My parents.&quot; And that would be it. They do not believe that an almighty Creator was involved in any way, just regular old people doing that regular old thing. A god is as unnecessary to explain human conception as it is to explain the conception of weasels. 

But just because an atheist is someone who lacks God-belief doesn&apos;t mean that all atheists believe in metaphysical naturalism (the idea that the physical, natural world is all there is). For instance, a Buddhist atheist might believe that there is a non-material component to all life, which we are unable to measure through our normal senses, but which accrues various amounts of karmic debt. This insubstantial essence lives on beyond us, and in fact incorporates itself into future iterations of the self. In that sense, such a person might reply &quot;My parents, me, and the karmic nature of the universe.&quot;

Most atheists, however, would likely consider this sort of non-divine supernaturalism as claptrap and nonsense. By far the most common answer is that we are created by the same mindless forces of nature responsible for every other living non-human creature we have ever seen.</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;What do you think happens to you when you die?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just in case there are any misconceptions about this, most serious atheists don&apos;t believe in reincarnation or spirits any more than we believe in hell. What defines &quot;you&quot; is what you think and feel, and how you interact with the universe. When this stops happening, you&apos;re not you anymore. So you simply stop existing.

If this idea scares you, think about all the millions of years that passed before you were born. Do you remember it? Was that scary? Interestingly enough, the fate that Christians find so inconceivable -- complete nonexistence -- is regarded by Buddhists as the best possible outcome for your life (&quot;Nirvana&quot;).

Some people take this a step further and argue this way: &quot;The first law of thermodynamics says that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since life is a form of energy, it must go somewhere.&quot; We don&apos;t see life as a self-contained form of energy. It&apos;s more of a process that matter and energy goes through.

Some people find this idea disturbing. They really want to be around forever. We all would. But realizing that you won&apos;t be around forever makes this life seem more valuable in a way. Since you only get one shot, it&apos;s important to do the best you can to be happy and make others happy before you&apos;re done.</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;You guys believe there is no God, but you can&apos;t prove that there isn&apos;t. So being an atheist obviously requires at least as much faith as being a Christian.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This assumption is rooted in the elementary logical fallacy that two opposite things--belief and disbelief--are actually the same thing. A basic tenet of logic is that anyone making a positive claim bears the burden of proof for that claim. For example, in a court of law the lawyers for the prosecution bear the burden of proof, because they are making the positive claim that the defendant has committed a crime.

To take a skeptical position regarding an extraordinary claim for which one has not been provided with compelling evidence is not an act of faith; it is simple common sense. Here is an analogous situation: supposedly, as a Christian, you do not believe in the Roman or Aztec gods. Is it just as much an &quot;act of faith&quot; on your part not to believe in those gods as it was for the Romans and Aztecs to believe in them? If a man walks up to you and says he has an invisible magic elf sitting on his head, do you automatically believe his claim? If not, is it an &quot;act of faith&quot; on your part not to? Or are you simply responding to the claim with common sense and skepticism because the man has failed to provide you with adequate evidence for his elf? Choosing not to believe in something when you have no reason to believe in that thing is not an act of faith, it is just the smart thing to do.

Finally, one can turn to the Bible&apos;s definition of faith--the &quot;substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&quot;--to see that this is a definition that excludes disbelief. So if you still don&apos;t agree with us that atheism is not a faith, then check your Bibles.</string>

		<string>America is a Christian nation.</string>
		<key>information</key>
		<string>&lt;b&gt;America is a Christian nation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The myth of a &quot;Christian&quot; United States goes something like this:

Christians seeking religious freedom founded our nation as a place where they could properly obey god&apos;s law. The Puritans and others founded biblical law settlements that established a Christian colonial culture. Christian leaders and ideals thus generated the American Revolution, our Constitutional democracy of personal freedom, and everything else that made our nation great. Bad things now happen because we have fallen away from our founders&apos; Christian values. America now needs religion in government and laws promoting religion so we can restore our lost Golden Age of Christian Faith.

Like most religious traditions, the evidence fails to support this Golden Age myth.

Puritan heritage is nothing anyone should be proud of or wish to restore. The Puritans came to the colonies to establish a religious tyranny. As a state church, Puritans oppressed other religions like they had been oppressed in England. They wanted religious freedom only in the sense that they wanted the freedom to practice their Puritanism and to punish or banish all other religious beliefs. Only Puritan Congregationalist churches were allowed. Baptists, Quakers, Presbyterians, Catholics and others were banished, often with a death sentence if they returned. Puritans punished even minor &quot;impious&quot; behavior, and they killed 25+ people as witches. America&apos;s colonial Christians were an undemocratic minority that opposed freedom of conscience and denied political rights based on religious beliefs.

The actions of the Constitution&apos;s authors at the 1787 Convention best reveal their thoughts and intent regarding religion. They avoided attempts to insert worship into their deliberations, keeping religious activities separate from the process of creating our government. If no religion at the Constitutional Convention was good enough for our founders, it should be good enough for all public officials in the execution of their duties.

Our founders created a secular government based on freethinking political philosophies. Our founders&apos; Constitution is a stunning rejection of government under god. Only the Constitution establishes our government, not any other document with pious words, such as the Declaration of Independence, Mayflower Act etc. The Constitution ignores god, except for the date, &quot;in the year of our Lord.&quot; &quot;We the People,&quot; not god, is the authority for our government. The Constitution prohibits any religious test for national office. The Constitution&apos;s first amendment prohibits Congress from passing any laws even &quot;respecting an establishment of religion.&quot; During many Constitution ratification sessions in the states, Christians tried to add references to God and Jesus into the Preamble and to remove the &quot;no religious test for office&quot; provision. Their failure demonstrates that even though the Constitution was a heated public issue, it was ratified as written. Our founders and the public knowingly chose a godless Constitution.

Conservative Christians argue that the First Amendment language, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,&quot; means our founders only meant to prohibit one denomination from becoming the official national religion. The evidence refutes this narrowest of interpretations, aside from the fact that the Constitution must give government such a power, and there is no power to do anything religious in the Constitution. In his letter to the Danbury Baptist Association (1/01/1802), Thomas Jefferson cited &quot;a wall of separation between Church and State&quot; as his reason for denying their request for a national day of fasting. Jefferson&apos;s metaphor came from London schoolmaster James Burgh, one of England&apos;s leading enlightenment political writers. Burgh&apos;s Crito (1767) had the phrase, &quot;build an impenetrable wall of separation between things sacred and civil.&quot; Along with numerous other documents, Jefferson&apos;s message clarifies the intention of the amendment.

The Constitution and amendments only mention religion three times, and only as prohibitions against government doing things religious. One cannot pervert express prohibitions against government doing religious things into powers for government to do religious things. Many public officials have a long history of violating their oath of office by mixing religion into government or by supporting religious groups. A tradition of violating the Constitution does not, however, change the Constitution. This traditional disrespect for the Constitution by religious believers should end.

We have an invaluable ally in our uphill struggle to preserve the truth. We have the words and actions of our founders, which directly contradict the myth of a &quot;Christian&quot; United States.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Don&apos;t atheists have basically empty, meaningless lives?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nope. We don&apos;t think that the world is an empty, meaningless place, even though we don&apos;t think a god designed it. We think the world is a fascinating, wonderful, interesting place, and we enjoy living in it. Now, you may think that it&apos;s impossible to &quot;really&quot; enjoy this world without believing of God as the designer. We don&apos;t feel that way.

Suppose you are walking in a beautiful garden with a friend, and your friend says, &quot;I heard there are fairies living in this garden!&quot; You tell your friend that you don&apos;t see any fairies, and you don&apos;t see any particular reason to believe that these fairies are there. You are just enjoying the garden. But your friend insists: &quot;How can you enjoy this place if you don&apos;t believe in fairies?&quot;

Unless you&apos;re a little kid, you would probably feel that your friend missed the point. Here you are, enjoying a nice day and great scenery, and your friend is trying to convince you to stop enjoying the garden the way it really is. He is telling you that you have to make something up, which isn&apos;t real as far as you can see, or else you don&apos;t have as much of an appreciation of the garden as he does.

In fact it is probably the other way around. It&apos;s a fine thing to have an imagination, but it seems like your friend is cheapening the experience, because he can&apos;t just enjoy something beautiful for its own sake.

The world has a lot of things to enjoy in it. Food, music, a well-told story, romance, sex, physical activity, the outdoors, the feeling of solving a difficult puzzle... just to name a few. These are things that most people enjoy on a day-to-day basis. And we don&apos;t appreciate the world around us any less for not thinking that those things come from God.

Also, it&apos;s not like there are no mysterious unknowns or &quot;greater forces&quot; right here in the physical universe. Most likely we will never know everything there is to know about this vast universe or our past. Who really understands quantum mechanics? Are there parallel universes out there? Are they accessible to us? Is time travel possible? Can we find a better way to generate our own energy before our sun burns out billions of years from now? These are all very big mysteries. One of life&apos;s great pleasures is applying your mind to solving hard questions like these. Learning is fun. Knowledge is fun. So it seems likely that we will never run out of things to enjoy in that sense.

You may have plenty of good reasons for believing in God, but if you think it&apos;s bad to be an atheist because atheists lead a cold, barren, loveless, uninteresting life, you are really kidding yourself.</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;What kind of horrible experience did you have that caused you to become an atheist?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians assume that everyone believes in God, and that people who pretend not to believe must have had a traumatic experience that made them hate God. Commonly it is assumed that an atheist must have, say, prayed to God and not been answered, or had a loved one die, and then renounced God in anger.

In reality, few people come to their atheism that way; and those who do usually don&apos;t stay atheist for very long. In the majority of cases, you&apos;ll find that atheists have thought very hard about their belief in God, and found that it just doesn&apos;t hang together logically. A great many atheists were raised in a religious household and decided, after much inner struggle, that they just couldn&apos;t continue to take their faith seriously. A few were brought up in atheist households and taught to think about the world and question conventional wisdom.

Ironically, many evangelists use their own stories of traumatic events as a way of convincing people to find religion. Often you will hear stories of how a person had &quot;hit rock bottom&quot;, was perpetually drunk and unemployed and had no hope for the future, and that&apos;s when they found the Lord. While they dismiss us by saying that we must have become atheists for dramatic emotional reasons, they use the same techniques to recruit new parishioners.</string>

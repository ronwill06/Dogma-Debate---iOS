    return @[@"David is a former Christian musician whose education in psychology,sociology, and world religions, with a deep-dive study of Christianity for more than 14 years, resulted in his atheism. He later became a secular activist and avid speaker, writer, and radio host. David quickly grew Dogma Debate from an idea, to an iHeartRadio show with millions of downloads. He is the former Editor-in-Chief of both Secular World & American Atheist magazines,the author of Baptized Atheist, and founder of AtheistAudiobooks.com. He is most known for his respectful approach to believers, most recently featured in the 2014 movie My Week in Atheism.",
             @"Lydia Allan has a passion for studying the human mind, obtaining her bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Texas A&M and her master’s degree in Neurobiology from Columbia University. During the pursuit of these degrees, she left the Christian faith, and the resulting loss of this world view system led her to pursue a second bachelor’s degree in Philosophy from University of Texas at Austin and a second master’s degree in History of Ideas from University of Texas at Dallas. Her current scholarly interests lie in philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, with specific interests in models of cognition and science policy formation in the midst of the “culture wars,” in which good science is affected by bad religion.",
             @"Cara Santa Maria has dedicated her life to improving science literacy by communicating scientific principles across media platforms. A North Texas native, she currently lives in Los Angeles. Prior to moving to the west coast, Cara taught biology and psychology courses to university undergraduates and high school students in Texas and New York. Her published research has spanned various topics, including clinical psychological assessment, the neuropsychology of blindness, neuronal cell culture techniques, and computational neurophysiology.",
             @"Donovan is the Content Producer for the show, managing the Sunday Question on Facebook, getting listener feedback, and helping with creative topics and research.",
             @"Alisha has always loved serving people.  Most of what she’s done in her personal, educational and professional life has been centered around service.  From her degree in Human Lifespan Development from Iowa State University, to her military service as an Army combat medic, she has always enjoyed helping people. She excels as a stay at home mother to two young boys, running her own cake decorator business, and lucky for us serves the Dogma Debate community in multiple capacities.  Her reason for becoming involved in the secular movement as an activist?   Her sons.  She wants them to grow up in a world free to be who they are without fear, regardless of their theistic positions. Alisha began her career with Dogma Debate in November 2013 like most Volunteers as a Research Analyst, only one year after she came out as an atheist. Alisha’s passion for helping people and her amazing work ethic earned her an appointment as Director of Member Services in August of 2014 before her most recent promotion."
